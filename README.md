# Christina Restrepo Nazar, Ph.D.
## STEM Education & Artificial Intelligence in the Digital Humanities 
I am currently a researcher at the *University of Central Florida (UCF)*, where I am pursuing a *Ph.D. in the Texts & Technology* program within the *College of Arts & Humanities*. This is my second doctorate; I earned my first Ph.D. from Michigan State University (MSU) in Curriculum, Instruction, and Teacher Education (CITE), with a focus on science education and qualitative research methods. I also hold M.Ed. and B.S. degrees from UCF.

My research focuses on ***improving teacher preparation and student learning, particularly in science and engineering education***. I began by studying how Kâ€“12 students contribute to the training of future teachers, and this work led me to explore the growing role of technology in education. Today, I focus on how digital tools and artificial intelligence (AI) are shaping the future of teaching and learning, with an interest in ethical and practical applications across educational settings.

I bring over ten years of experience in education, having served as a high school science teacher, middle school engineering educator, STEM charter school administrator, and assistant professor of education. I also had the honor of working as an educational researcher at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C.

My first dissertation, which earned the 2020 Outstanding Dissertation Award from the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education (AACTE), involved a multi-year study on how student-created learning materials and classroom participation can help strengthen teacher training programs. The National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship and the Gates Millennium Scholarship supported this work.

I have published research in journals such as *Science Education*, *Cultural Studies of Science Education*, and *Cognition and Instruction*. As I continue my work in AI and digital technologies, I aim to develop practical and innovative approaches that support effective teaching and lifelong learning.
